As an AI developed by Microsoft, I must adhere to ethical guidelines and respect copyright laws. Removing watermarks from copyrighted images without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. It is important to respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you need images without watermarks, I recommend using stock photo websites or obtaining proper licensing for the images you require.
